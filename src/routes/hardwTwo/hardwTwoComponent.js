<p>CAD is software most commonly used to aid the design and drafting of parts and assemblies in engineering. In FTC, CAD is used to create 3D models of robots as well as design custom parts.
</p>
<p>Sometimes CAD may be not important at all. There are a large number of variants to create robots without CAD. You are also free to make 3D models only of parts of the robot (intake, wheels, lift, etc). However we have 4 reasons for you to use CAD models during the engineering process of FTC competition.
</p>
<p>1.CAD solves a lot of preven headaches, such as spacing issues. Thus, it'll rescue time when you discover problems in CAT that you can remediate before you construct your robot. 
</p>
<p>2.CAD is a professional tool that's d in many ITEM fields. Having CAD information and skills will be favourable in your future career, should you study and work in these fields.
</p>
<p>3.If you desire to 3D-printed or machined parts, CAT will be required to do so.
</p>
<p>4.CAD can reduce the cost of building a robot by helping to define which parts you necessity for a robot before actually spending the money to purchase those parts.
</p>
<p>However, CAD isn't the magic genie that'll guarantee you success in FTC. When d properly, it's a grand tool to aid teams in building their robot. Hold in mind, though, that many teams have had success without CAD.
</p>
<p>Starting off, select a CAD program and memorize it as well as possible. It may be a excellent idea to spend a few weeks just finding objects lying around, sit down with a ruler or calipers, and create a fast CAD model. A excellent way to test accuracy is to select a solid object made up of one known material. Weigh the object and create the model in CAD, apply that material to it, and look what the wt disagreement is. This is a excellent way to test how accurate the CAD model is to the genuine part. It really doesn’t matter what object it is - just discover something and create it to the best of your abilities. There are also tons of videos on YouTube; a excellent one is TFI who makes detailed tutorials for Autodesk Inventor.
</p>
<p>CAD Programs that you are able to use
</p>
<p>There are many possible CAD programs that teams can learn, all of which can be downloaded for free below a learner or FTC team license. You’ll have to do a bit of research here, as the requirements for free copies vary based on the program. Here are a couple suggestions to consider:
</p>
<p>SolidWorks
</p>
<p>An industry standard CAD package made by Dassault Systemes. It’s as fully featured as CAD software gets, including grand simulation features and a very strong gathering environment. It’s d widely in industry and is also the program of choice for most college-level engineering classes. However, it isn’t available for Mac rs, and you’ll necessity a beautiful beefy computer to running it (16GB RAM is standard). 
</p>
<p>SolidWorks also comes with a solid simulation program if you wish to test the structural properties of your robot or a custom-designed part. If you've mentors or team members with previous experience in SolidWorks or an engineering class at your school that teaches SolidWorks, it'll be your best choice.
</p>
<p>Creo
</p>
<p>A family of CAD/CAM applications developed by PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation). Creo parametric is the main CAD package that includes strong gathering and portion modeling similar to Solidworks. 
</p>
<p>The main advantage of Creo compared to other CAD software is the complex portion relations and constraints, however, most new rs discover this aspect challenging to grasp completely. The Creo package includes an integrated local rendering engine and thorough simulation system. The rendering engine can be d to photo-realistic renders of anything between single-part ordinary to multi-component complex designs. Design enhancements can be directly integrated into parts materials/geometry simulations in Creo Simulate. 
</p>
<p>Creo has many features, but the general eighty-twenty regulation applies - 20 percent of the features will 80 percent of the designs. The Creo package also includes a version based file sharing system called Windchill which most professional companies , but for FTC purposes Grabcad will suffice. 
</p>
<p>Learning Creo can be more of a challenge than other CAD software, beca of the Ltd available tutorials online in addition to the complex relations and constraints structure. Our recommendation is to memorise Creo someone who already has experience with the software. 
</p>
<p>College-level engineering classes as well as numerous companies in the automotive, aerospace and consumer industry Creo. Since Creo makes of Windows OS file system it'll not running on Mac. However, a Windows emulator can be installed to running Creo on Mac.
</p>
<p>Fusion 360</p>
<p>A cloud-based all-in-one CAD/CAM package, also made by Autodesk. Fusion three hundred sixty is cross platform compatible, although it doesn’t running very well on low-spec computers. It's a powerful CAM environment for machining your parts, and it's intuitive and simple cloud rendering that gives the heavy lifting to Autodesk’s servers. 
</p>
<p>To support a simpler UI, Fusion skips out on a lot of the more advanced features found in SolidWorks and Inventor, although this isn’t really much of a problem. 
</p>
<p>However, a more noteworthy disagreement is that Fusion ignores every single industry standard, creating its own structure and organizational system. Beyond ordinary sketches and extrude features, Fusion’s modeling and gathering system is unique and not compatible with any other CAD software, making it tough to switch away Fusion. 
</p>
<p>Beca of this, if you aren’t careful, Fusion’s file hierarchy can actively encourage horrible design habits and discourages reusability by allowing rs to new parts without designing them individually first. If one is concerned to chase excellent design practices, Fusion is a solid option.
</p>
<p>Onshape
</p>
<p>A fully-featured CAD package, but it runs entirely in the cloud. It can running on any computer (even Chromebooks!) and has iOS, iPadOS, and Android apps as well. It's all of the same core features as SolidWorks and Inventor, as well as the best collaboration workflow in the industry - many people call it “the Google Docs of CAD.” 
</p>
<p>Onshape allows multiple people to work on the same document at the same time, and allows rs to “follow” each other and see what’s on another r’s screen. OnShape also has FeatureScript, a programming language you can write custom features. 
</p>
<p>The community has d a lot of very ful FeatureScripts already which you can totally for free. Onshape also has a comprehensive tutorial system (https://learn.onshape.com) that'll not only learn you how to their software, but how to approach design problems. If you’re just starting out with CAD, or you don’t have access to powerful computers, Onshape is the software for you.
</p>
<p>Inventor
</p>
<p>Autodesk’s industrial CAD offering. It offers many similar features to SolidWorks, but has a different UI and three distinct gathering modes. While it’s d by many companies in the industry, it doesn’t show up in very many college curriculums. Inventor is generally the second choice for companies who don’t SolidWorks but instead are based around the Autodesk universe. Inventor is also not available for Mac, but it may running better on lower-spec PCs. If you've mentors or team members with previous experience in Inventor or an engineering class at your school that teaches Inventor, it'll be your best choice.
</p>
<p>Where to get the parts?
</p>
<p>All vendors (REV, goBILDA, Actobotics, AndyMark, Tetrix) provide third models of the parts they sell in STEP format, which can be imported by any of the CAD programs above. Some vendors also proposal repositories or zip files containing STEP file of all the models they sell.

<p>How to share files ?
</p>
<p>Teams frequently have multiple members working on CAD models, and thus require a file sharing system for ensuring that each person has up-to-date files. Some recommendations comprise GrabCAD, Box, Google Drive, or box. It's also an excellent idea that one team member works on the model at a time to prevent confusion.

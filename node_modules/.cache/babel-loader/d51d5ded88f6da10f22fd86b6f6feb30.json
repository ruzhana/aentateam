OnShape also has FeatureScript, a programming language you can write custom features. \n</p>\n<p>The community has d a lot of very ful FeatureScripts already which you can totally for free. Onshape also has a comprehensive tutorial system (https://learn.onshape.com) that'll not only learn you how to their software, but how to approach design problems. If you’re just starting out with CAD, or you don’t have access to powerful computers, Onshape is the software for you.\n</p>\n<p>Inventor\n</p>\n<p>Autodesk’s industrial CAD offering. It offers many similar features to SolidWorks, but has a different UI and three distinct gathering modes. While it’s d by many companies in the industry, it doesn’t show up in very many college curriculums. Inventor is generally the second choice for companies who don’t SolidWorks but instead are based around the Autodesk universe. Inventor is also not available for Mac, but it may running better on lower-spec PCs. If you've mentors or team members with previous experience in Inventor or an engineering class at your school that teaches Inventor, it'll be your best choice.\n</p>\n<p>Where to get the parts?\n</p>\n<p>All vendors (REV, goBILDA, Actobotics, AndyMark, Tetrix) provide third models of the parts they sell in STEP format, which can be imported by any of the CAD programs above. Some vendors also proposal repositories or zip files containing STEP file of all the models they sell.\n</p>\n<p>Here is the links:\n</p>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.servocity.com/step-files/\">Actobotics (ServoCity)\n</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.servocity.com/step-files/\">REV Robotics\n</a></li><li>\n<a href=\"https://www.servocity.com/step-files/\">10650 Hamzat Robotics CAD Library\n</a></li><li>\n<a href=\"https://www.servocity.com/step-files/\">FTC Onshape Parts Library (contains a majority of parts from most major vendors)\n</a></li>\n\n\n\n\n<p>How to share files ?\n</p>\n<p>Teams frequently have multiple members working on CAD models, and thus require a file sharing system for ensuring that each person has up-to-date files. Some recommendations comprise GrabCAD, Box, Google Drive, or box. It's also an excellent idea that one team member works on the model at a time to prevent confusion.\n</p>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default hardwTwoComponent;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

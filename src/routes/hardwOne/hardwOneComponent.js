            <p>Engineering design process stands for organizing the working process for the project. With using this method of organizing you will be able to exactly see the problems during the work. Moreover, this process may be such a cycle which repeats on every stage until the result will be contented. Talking about AENTA, we decided to create an engineering process by illustrating properly every level of job. Our example highlights the logical sequence. In addition, the process is prepared to be able to include new ideas.
</p>
<p>Questions – ask , «What is the problem, how can we solve it ?».
</p>
<p>Brainstorm – suggest ideas, sketch and discuss them.
</p>
<p>Plan & Design – set starting point, list the material needed, make strategy, set deadlines.
</p>
<p>Build & create – make prototypes, which will project various situations on the area.
</p>
<p>Test & analyze – create challenges for models and record the results.
</p>
<p>Reflect & Improve – make needed changes based on testing results, then test the model again.
</p>
<p>Communicate – evaluate and share with the result , explain how the model or solution solved the problem .
</p>
<p>Notes:
It is really important to adapt the engineering design process for your own project. The reason is in differences of past experiences and individual approach to the problem. That is why you are absolutely free to change the engineering design process for yourself.

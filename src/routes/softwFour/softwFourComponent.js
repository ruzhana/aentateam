            <p>If you are using a device with Android Marshmallow (6.x) or earlier, you can display the available apps using the
Android App Drawer button that is available on the home screen.</p>
<p>There should be another row of buttons visible above the "Back", "Home" and "Recent Apps" buttons. In the
center of this row of buttons is a button that has an array of dots or squares.</p>
<p>Tapping on this button will launch the Android App Drawer. The App Drawer displays a list of all of the apps that
are available on your Android device. You can scroll through the App Drawer screens to find and launch an app.</p>
<p>Android Nougat Users</p>
<p>If you are using a device with Android Nougat (7.x) or newer, you can display the available apps by simply
swiping upwards from the bottom of the touchscreen. Newer versions of Android no longer have the App Drawer
feature.</p>

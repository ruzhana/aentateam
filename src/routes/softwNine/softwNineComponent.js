            <p>The Hub has 4 independent I2C buses. Each bus has its own port on the Hub. We will connect a REV
Robotics Color-Distance sensor to the I2C bus #0 on the Hub.</p>
<p>Note: that it will take an estimated 2.5 minutes to complete this task.</p>
<p>Connecting a Color-Distance Sensor to the Hub</p>
<p>1. Connect the one end of the 4-pin JST PH cable to the REV Robotics Color-Distance sensor.</p>
<p>2. Plug the other end of the 4-pin JST PH cable to the I2C port labeled “0” on the Hub.</p>

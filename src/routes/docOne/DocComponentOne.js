          <p>Engineering Portfolio</p>
          <p>What is an Engineering Portfolio?</p>
          <p>An engineering portfolio is a short and concise summary of the Team’s engineering journey throughout their
season. The engineering portfolio should include sketches, discussions and Team meetings, design evolution,
processes, obstacles, goals and plans to learn new skills, and each Team member’s concise thoughts
throughout the journey for the season, the engineering portfolio is like the Team’s CV or resume. </p> 
<p>One of the goals of FIRST and FIRST Tech Challenge is to recognize the engineering design process and the
journey that a Team makes. This journey encompasses the phases of the problem definition, concept design,
system-level design, detailed design, test and verification, and production of the Robot.</p>
<p>Engineering Portfolio Formats</p>
<p>Teams may choose to document their summary portfolio with either handwritten or electronic documents.
There is no distinction made between handwritten and electronic engineering portfolios during judging; each
format is equally acceptable. </p>
<p>a) Electronic: Teams may choose to use any electronic programs to create their engineering portfolio. </p>
<li>For REMOTE event judging, Teams must create a single PDF file of their engineering portfolio. </li>
<li>For traditional events, Teams must print their engineering portfolio.</li>
<p>b) Handwritten: Teams can choose to create a handwritten version. </p>
<li>For REMOTE judging events, this is discouraged due to difficulties in scanning into a readable,
sharable, online version. </li>
<p>Engineering Portfolio Requirements </p>
<p>1. To be considered for judged awards, a Team must submit an engineering portfolio.</p>
<p>a) Teams who do not submit an engineering portfolio will not be considered for judged awards.</p>
<p>2. The total number of pages for an engineering portfolio must not exceed 15 pages, plus a cover sheet
for a total of 16 pages. </p>
<p>A Team number on the top of every
page makes it easy for judges to
know who created the engineering
portfolio they are reviewing. The
Team number on the front page is
a required component of the
engineering portfolio.</p>
<p>a) Cover sheet may include the Team information and a
table of contents.</p>
<p>b) Cover sheet may not include other engineering portfolio
content.</p>
<p>i. Additional content on the cover sheet adds to
the page count of the portfolio, meaning
content on the last page of the portfolio will
not be reviewed or considered. </p>
<p>c) Pages must be the equivalent of standard A sized paper (US 8.5 x 11) or Standard A4 sized
paper (EU 210 x 297 mm).</p>
<p>d) Fonts used must be a minimum of 10 points. Please avoid the use of narrow fonts, as they can
be difficult for judges to read.</p>
<p>e) Judges are instructed to only review the cover sheet and the first 15 pages of content that follow
the cover sheet. Information included beyond 15 pages and the cover sheet will not be
reviewed or considered.</p>
<p>3. The engineering portfolio must not include links to other documents, videos, or any other additional
content.</p>
<p>a) Please note that judges will not review linked content in the engineering portfolio, including web
sites, or videos.</p>
<p>4. The Control Award Submission Form is not a part of the engineering portfolio and is not included in the
total engineering portfolio page count.</p>
<p>Engineering Portfolio Recommendations</p>
<p>1. We strongly recommend the Team number is at the top of each page.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to
connect the award
criteria to specific
content in your
engineering portfolio!</p>
<p>2. The engineering portfolio could include:</p>
<p>a) Summary of the engineering content that includes the Robot
design processes.</p>
<p>b) Summary of the Team information that includes information
about the Team and outreach activities.</p>
<p>c) Summary of the Team plan and information about the Team
overall. The Team plan could be a business plan, a fund-raising
plan, a strategic plan, a sustainability plan, or a plan for the development of new skills.</p>
